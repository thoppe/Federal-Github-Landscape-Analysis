# Federal GitHub Landscape Analysis

_Survey, Analyze, and report on all Federal GitHub Code_

As of December 2024, there is no consolidated inventory of all U.S. Federal open-source code repositories. This project is an attempt to survey the Federal landscape of open-source code across GitHub.

## Methodology and Assumptions

With nearly 200 million users on GitHub, evaluating all accounts would be unfeasible.  
Instead, we limit this project to _organizations_ that associate themselves with a .gov domain in their registration email or associated URL.  
After sampling all 9 million organizations (as of **XXXX**), we identified **XXXX** organizations for human verification.  
Of these, **XXXX** are associated with the U.S. Federal government.

This project does not cover repositories that are not on GitHub or not associated with a .gov organization.

Excluding clones, there are **XXXX** repositories in these organizations.

## Project Description

Despite the increasing adoption of open-source practices, there is currently no centralized repository to manage and track source code produced by U.S. Federal agencies, including research projects, software, and website development (both front-end and back-end). Code.gov was launched to address this gap but has consistently fallen short of compliance and broader adoption. This project aims to build on the open-source movement by achieving three key objectives:

+ Conduct a comprehensive survey of Federal open-source code hosted on GitHub by directly identifying relevant organizations.
+ Analyze the ecosystem, including trends in programming language usage and collaboration networks.
+ Archive Federal repositories to ensure their availability and continuity, especially in anticipation of potential disruptions during an administration change.

## Goals

+ Host the archived data with a user-friendly front-end interface.
+ Develop and publish a research report detailing the survey findings and ecosystem analysis.

## Current Progress

To date, all 9 million GitHub organizations have been assessed to identify Federal agency affiliations, with clear distinctions made for State, Local, and Tribal governments. Additionally, a shallow copy of the associated repositories has been initiated as part of the archiving effort.
