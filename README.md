# Federal GitHub Landscape Analysis

_Survey of All Federal GitHub Organizations_

_WORK IN PROGRESS_



As of December 2024, there is no consolidated inventory of all U.S. Federal open-source code repositories.  
This project is an attempt to survey the Federal landscape of open-source code across GitHub.

## Methodology and Assumptions

With nearly 200 million users on GitHub, evaluating all accounts would be unfeasible.  
Instead, we limit this project to _organizations_ that associate themselves with a .gov domain in their registration email or associated URL.  
After sampling all 9 million organizations (as of **XXXX**), we identified **XXXX** organizations for human verification.  
Of these, **XXXX** are associated with the U.S. Federal government.

This project does not cover repositories that are not on GitHub or not associated with a .gov organization.

Excluding clones, there are **XXXX** repositories in these organizations.
